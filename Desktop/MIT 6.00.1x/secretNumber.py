#In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!

#The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 
#0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The computer makes guesses, 
#and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? 
#Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!
 
#Please think of a number between 0 and 100!
#Is your secret number 50?
#Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. 
#Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low.
#Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.
